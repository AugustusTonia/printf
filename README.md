"printf" is the name of one of the main C output functions, and stands for "print formatted". printf format strings are complementary to scanf format strings, which provide formatted input.
You can print all of the normal C types with printf by using different placeholders:
int (integer values) uses %d.
float (floating point values) uses %f.
char (single character values) uses %c.
character strings (arrays of characters, discussed later) use %s.
